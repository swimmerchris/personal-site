            <h2>Scuba Diving</h2>
            
            <p>I've always loved the idea of being able to breathe underwater. Growing up I swam all the time and would often dive down in the pool and sit on the bottom, holding my breathe. I imagined a day when I could stay down longer than I could hold my breathe. When the opportunity came for me to take a scuba diving course  in college I jumped at the chance. I became an open water scuba diver after that</p>
            <p>In my diving adventures, I've dove across the carribean and off the coast of North Carolina. Some of my most memorable dives were off the belize barrier reef where I got to dive the blue hole. This is a massive sink whole off that goes 400ft down. I've scuba dove with sharks, turle, ship wrecks and much more.</p>

            <h2>Mountain Biking</h2>
            <p>I started Mountain biking when I was in high school. Being outdoors and flying down a trail was an exhilarating experience. I started out on a basic mountain bike and quickly realized I need something more aggressive. I upgraded to a bike with better suspension, tires and handling. I would fly down trails at high speeds diving into gullies with no fear.</p>
            <p>I continiued mountain biking into college. As I transition into my life in military I had to slow down my mountain biking fun. After leaving the military I was able to start back mountain biking I still find a ton of joy in mountain biking I just don't go as aggressive as I use to.</p>

            <h2>Disney World</h2>
            <p>I grew up going to Disney World and developed a passion for the parks when I was young. As I grew older I visited the parks less and less but I still enjoyed going. When I moved to california in the military I got annual passes for me and my wife. I was skeptical if they were a good purchase or not. We went for a weekend and the first day we stayed till the fireworks. During the fireworks show the magic of disney came to life, as project showed up on main street usa, the castle and the matterhorn. This along with the great music and fireworks sparked my passion again and I haven't looked back.</p>
            <p>I now enjoy taking my wife and three children to Disney every year to year and a half. We usually spend a week or more at the parks and always have a blast. I believe my passion for the creativity of Disney helps my creativity in my work.
